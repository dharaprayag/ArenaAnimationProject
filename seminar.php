                        <h2>Seminar</h2>
                        <p>A seminar is a form of academic instruction, either at an academic institution or offered by a commercial or professional organization. It has the function of bringing together small groups for recurring meetings, focusing each time on some particular subject, in which everyone present is requested to participate. This is often accomplished through an ongoing Socratic dialogue with a seminar leader or instructor, or through a more formal presentation of research. It is essentially a place where assigned readings are discussed, questions can be raised and debates can be conducted.</p>
                        <p>A seminar is a commercial program where attendees are given information or training about a specific topic. A seminar is usually held for groups of 10 to 50 individuals and frequently takes place at a hotel meeting space, an academic institution, or within an office conference room. Some common types of seminars in business focus on personal development or business strategies.</p>
                        <p>A trade seminar brings a wide cross-section of the community together, such as government officials, businessmen and women and the general public. Such seminars often consist of workshops and the presentation of white papers. They are usually held for the purpose of networking with various vendors and making new connections.</p>
